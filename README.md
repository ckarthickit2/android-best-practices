### Git-Hooks

-  Currently Targeting only `MacOS` and `Linux` machines.

- Relies on the fact that developers will at-least `clean` or `assemble` once before committing any code.

## BikeShedding
AKA, Parkinson's Law of triviality
- argument that members of an organization give disproportionate weight to trivial issues.
- Parkinson provides the example of a fictional committee whose job was to approve the plans for a nuclear power plant spending the majority of its time on discussions about relatively minor but easy-to-grasp issues, such as what materials to use for the staff bike shed, while neglecting the proposed design of the plant itself, which is far more important and a far more difficult and complex task.
Occurs when a development team spends a disproportionate amount of time and effort on a trivial or unimportant detail of a system, such as the color of a bikeshed
